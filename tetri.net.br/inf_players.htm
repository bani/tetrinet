<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I've played 
  a lot of games and seen a lot of players, the good, the bad and the ugly. This 
  essay will concentrate on the third group. These are the people that you can 
  find in public servers, playing their first games or even chugging along on 
  their last ones. It is said that a man is defined by his actions and not by 
  his words, and in this case, I truly wonder upon the nature of the opponents 
  that fate has put before me...</font></p>
<p align="justify"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>The 
  Pure Player<br>
  </b>The Pure Player is someone who has played a lot of Gameboy Tetris, or any 
  type of old-school Tetris game. He is convinced that he is the greatest Tetris 
  player in the Galaxy, and that all others must succumb to his supreme technique. 
  The kind of game that he is currently playing (1:1, 2:1, ffa, 1v1, whatever) 
  is unimportant. He will always begin the game by trying to make The Perfect 
  Tetris. The fact that his opponent just cleared a line and got a blockquake 
  does not concern him. If he is disrupted in his god-like activity (someone messes 
  up his field, which is admittedly very tempting to do) he will in most cases 
  accuse the infringant of playing "cheap". The Pure Player can be found having 
  limited success in 6 player ffa games (the others are too busy concentrating 
  on the real players to care about the damn fool stacking himself to death - 
  besides, The Pure Player doesn't know how to use the specials). In 1v1 games, 
  he will invariably lose.</font></p>

<p align="justify"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>The 
  Elite Player<br>
  </b>The Elite Player is someone who has played the game of TetriNET for a long 
  time. Often he tries to convince others that it is for far longer than what 
  is actually the truth, but nevertheless, he's played it long enough to have 
  made up a private set of rules for the game. If anyone should break these rules, 
  he will be absolutely infuriated and spend the remainder of the session exclusively 
  trying to murder the heretic and not giving a damn about any other field. The 
  problem is, noone except for The Elite Player knows these rules. The rules can 
  be of any kind, and mostly they circle around not being "cheap". Common examples 
  are "block bombs are cheap", "switching in the beginning of the game is cheap" 
  and "Using all the specials on one player is cheap". From there on it can go 
  to the most bizarre conventions, such as "clearing my lines is lame", "making 
  a tetris in the end game is rude", "saving your nukes is lame" etc. The Elite 
  Player does not recognize that the main objective of the game is to win, however, 
  he often gets most annoyed when he does not. He frequently accuses other players 
  of cheating, because he just can't imagine anyone being better or faster than 
  he is.</font></p>

  Special: Block Gravity</i></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>The 
  Pacifist<br>
  </b>The Pacifist is someone who does not enjoy violence. She (for it is most 
  often a she) will take every step necessary not to offend anyone. Many times, 
  she will not use her offensive specials at all. Sometimes, these people can 
  be seen clearing their own specs, but that is rare. Like a squirrel, she will 
  stockpile all the valuable specs she can find and use them in times of dire 
  trouble. An offspring of this species is the "Merciful Samarite", who can be 
  seen helping other players as they are about to die. She will not talk much 
  either during game or in chat, and she will not be noticed by the other players 
  unless she manages to get hold of a load of nukes, in which case she'll prolong 
  the game incessantly and prove to be a complete nuisance.</font></p>

  Special: Nuke Field</i></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>The 
  Grim Reaper<br>
  </b>The Grim Reaper is the reverse image of The Merciful Samarite. He loves 
  violence, however, he can not stand being subjected to it. In multiplayer games, 
  he will stockpile offensive specials, and as soon as he sees a player in deep 
  trouble, he will use them all on him in hope of killing him off before he gets 
  a chance to react. Experienced Reapers will only use as many specials as necessary, 
  and only on players he is certain do no longer possess any offensive capabilities. 
  After killing one player, The Grim Reaper will feel mighty proud of himself, 
  and even if he should lose, he will still be able to say to himself, "yeah, 
  but at least I got that son of a bitch". These players are the ones who used 
  to bully the small children in school and run errands for the big ones. His 
  tactic is designed to let him get away from trouble, however, after a couple 
  of games there will be so many players pissed off at him that his life will 
  become very troublesome indeed. In this case, The Reaper will give some whining 
  comment about everyone attacking only him and then abruptly change servers.</font></p>
<p align="right"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>Favorite 
  Special: Add Line</i></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>The 
  Avenger (or The Kamikaze Pilot)<br>
  </b>The Avenger is a peaceful man until troubled. In fact, he often proves to 
  be a peaceful man until just before death. He will save all his specials during 
  the game and only use them when absolutely necessary. However, his grudges will 
  continue to mount towards all other players. As he is about to die, he will 
  determine which of his adversaries are most to blame, and unload all his specials 
  on him. If his opponent dies, he will be pleased. Many Kamikazes don't know 
  very much about the use of the specials. This means that they will inadvertently 
  throw in a gravity or a nuke in the salvo. Usually, this prompts laughter from 
  the other players. This will make the Kamikaze Pilot very angry.</font></p>
<p align="right"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>Favorite 
  Special: Blockquake</i></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>The 
  Police Constable<br>
  </b>This player is one who is more interested in looking for evidence of foul 
  play than he is in actually playing. Generally, The Police Constable's agenda 
  can be summarized this way: If you win more than two games in a row, you cheat. 
  If you kill the Constable, you cheat. If you use more than three adds in a row, 
  you cheat. The more extreme variants of The Police Constable will accuse you 
  of cheating if you add more than two lines to all. Ironically, The Police Constable 
  is often cheating himself, and if you happen to win too frequently, he will 
  suddenly transform into Mr Superman and give you 22 adds before anyone has had 
  the chance to get a special, saying something in the vein of "You had that one 
  coming, BITCH". The Police Constable is a very poor player and will never win 
  unless he cheats, which is why he believes everyone who wins does.</font></p>
<p align="right"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>Favorite 
  Special: Clear Special Blocks</i></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">These are 
  but a few of the types, beware! There are more, as of yet unaccounted for. </font></p>
